# SQL-Project-on-Online-Book-Store
This project involves analyzing data from a bookstore using three CSV files: Books.csv, Customers.csv, and Orders.csv. These files are linked using common columns like Book_ID and Customer_ID, forming a relational dataset.


### üìÇ Data Files:
- **Books.csv**: Contains details of each book including `Book_ID`, `Genre`, `Author`, `Price`, `Stock`, etc.
- **Customers.csv**: Contains customer information like `Customer_ID`, `Name`, `Country`, `City`, etc.
- **Orders.csv**: Stores order-related information with fields such as `Order_ID`, `Customer_ID`, `Book_ID`, `Quantity`, and `Order_Date`.

### ‚úÖ Objectives:
Perform both **Basic** and **Advanced SQL Queries** to extract meaningful insights from the data.

### üß∞ Tools Used
- CSV Files (as database tables)
- SQL for query execution

### üìå How to Run
1. Load CSV files into a SQL engine or a data processing tool (e.g., Pandas with SQLite).
2. Execute each query to analyze trends, sales, and inventory.
3. Use the query outputs for reporting or visualization.
